## NAME: HAREVASU S
## REGISTRATION NUMBER: 2122232330069
## Aim
To develop a project Course Reservation and Exam Registration System using 
Rational Rose Software and to implement the software in Java.

## PROBLEMSTATEMENT: 
• Effective for Administration Purpose  
• Cost effective  
• Better Services 

## Use case Diagrams

A use case is a methodology used in system analysis to identify, clarify, and 
organize system requirements. The use case is made up of a set of possible sequences 
of interactions between systems and users in a particular environment and related to a 
particular goal. It is represented using ellipse. Actor is any external entity that makes 
use of the system being modeled.

## Activity Diagram

An activity diagram is a variation or special case of a state machine in which 
the states or activity representing the performance of operation and transitions are 
triggered by the completion of operation. The purpose is to provide view of close and 
what is going on inside a use case or among several classes. An activity is shown as 
rounded box containing the name of operation.

## Sequence Diagram:

A sequence diagram in Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a kind of 
interaction diagram that shows how processes operate with one another and in what 
order.

## Class diagram:

A class is drawn as rectangle box with three compartments or components 
separated by horizontal lines. The top compartment holds the class name and middle 
compartment holds the attribute and bottom compartment holds list of operations.

## Collaboration diagram:

A collaboration diagram is similar to sequence diagram but the message in 
number format. In a collaboration diagram sequence diagram is indicated by the 
numbering the message. A collaboration diagram, also called a communication 
diagram or interaction diagram, A sophisticated modeling tool can easily convert a 
collaboration diagram into a sequence diagram and the vice versa. A collaboration 
diagram resembles a flowchart that portrays the roles, functionality and behavior of 
individual objects as well as the overall operation of the system in real time.

## Result:
Thus, the Student information system project was executed and the output  
was verified.
